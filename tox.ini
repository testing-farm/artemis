# Conditionals don't support multiline branches, therefore codecov upload is a separate step.
# but that's fine, thanks to options we give it it knows where to find coverage (specific for
# Python version), and we even tell it to add Python version as a flag - keeping coverage
# separate even in Codecov seems to be a good starting point, we can always start merging
# them later.
#
# And there's an advantage: the codecov upload does not run when one runs *-unit-tests env locally.
# It'd fail anyway, since one does not usually have CODECOV_TOKEN set, and it's still possible
# to run it explicitly to upload one's local coverage in case of need.
