== Routing policies

=== `one-shot-only`

If a guest request has a specific key in its `user-data` field, this policy would cancel the request should it enter routing for the second time.
In other words, when the first routing and provisioning attempt fails, there would be no second attempt.

The key to look for in `user-data` can be set via `route.policies.one-shot-only.label` knob, or `ARTEMIS_ROUTE_POLICIES_ONE_SHOT_ONLY_LABEL`
environment variable.
By default, it is set to `ArtemisOneShotOnly`.
