== Beaker

=== Beaker groups

To avoid provisioning machines owned by particular Beaker groups, driver can be configured to avoid them.

.Specification
[source,yaml]
....
avoid-groups:
  - group-1
  - group-2
  ...
....

.Example
[source,yaml]
....
avoid-groups:
  # While our Beaker account has access to these groups, don't provision machines owned by them.
  - special-gpus
  - laptops
....

[TIP]
====
It is possible to configure multiple pools for the same set of Beaker credentials, each with different `avoid-groups` list. For example:

[source,yaml]
....
# pool #1
avoid-groups:
  - laptops

# pool #2
avoid-groups:
  - generic-group-owning-machines-not-owned-by-any-other-group
....

This way, common guest requests can be routed to pool #1, while requests in the need of a special laptop HW would be routed to pool #2.
