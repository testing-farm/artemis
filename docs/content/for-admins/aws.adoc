== AWS

=== Image owners

When searching for images, AWS driver would list all images owned by the `self` owner, i.e. it is limited by images owned by the given credentials. To expand this set, it is possible to explicitly set the list of owners to include when looking for images a pool can use for provisioning.

.Specification
[source,yaml]
....
image-owners:
  - owner-1
  - owner-2
  ...
....

.Example
[source,yaml]
....
image-owners:
  - self
  - another-owner
  - some-other-account
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once you opt in and use `image-owners` option, the list would be used **instead** of the default one, with `self` only. Therefore if you do wish to keep `self` in play, you need to make it one of the items of the `image-owners` list, as shown in the example above.
