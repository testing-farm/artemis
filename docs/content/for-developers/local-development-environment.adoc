[IMPORTANT]
====
The most common environment developers and maintainers of Artemis use is Fedora, of a reasonably recent version, 31+. The "howto" described below is written with respect to this fact, and it is highly likely it would be a bit harder to follow on Debian or other Linux distributions. Please, bear with us.

Any patches to extend this text to non-Fedora realms would be very welcomed.
====

There are two possible way how to prepare and use a local environment for developing with Artemis:

* using https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift[Minishift] and https://skaffold.dev[Skaffold]. This way, Artemis code is wrapped by containers, and runs side to side with other required services on top of a Minishift cluster, which is very similar to how Artemis is actually deployed.
+
[NOTE]
====
Currently, the development environment requires Docker to be installed on the machine, as Skaffold uses Docker API for building the container images.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, the most recent versions of Skaffold are not working properly for our use case, use https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/v1.5.0/skaffold-linux-amd64[version 1.5] instead.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, the most recent versions of Minishift are not working properly for our use case, use version `v1.29.0` instead.
====
+
* using https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] for required services, and running Artemis directly on your workstation. This way is much more flexible than the first choice, and allows for very quick development, but it not how Artemis is deployed after all, and in some corner cases, things may behave differently.
+
[WARNING]
====
This way Artemis source runs in the same environment as the rest of the processes of your workstation. If you do not want to allow that, and you wish to keep Artemis isolated from the rest of your workstation, do not use this method.
====

== Create configuration

No matter which way you chose, you will need a configuration for your Artemis server. Create the development configuration in the `server/configuration/` directory.

[NOTE]
====
The configuration must have a flat structure, without any subdirectories.
====

You can use samples and `server/configuration/gen.sh` script which will setup Artemis to use your existing OpenStack project:

* copy the `env.yml.sample` file:
+
[source,shell]
....
$ cd server/configuration
$ cp env.yml.sample env.yml
....
+
* edit this new `env.yml` file, provide details of the cloud accounts you would like to use with Artemis (removing configuration for those you don't need) and
 an SSH key pair to be used by Artemis as its master-key.
* create an SSH keypair for Artemis.
+
[NOTE]
====
You may skip this step if you are not starting from the scratch, but rather work with already existing keys and prepared tenants.
====
+
In case of OpenStack or AWS clouds you should also create a keypair with the public key in the OpenStack tenant or AWS account, the keypair name
should match the `openstack.vms.keyname` or `aws.vms.keyname` in your `env.yml`, respectively.
For example, if you set `openstack.vms.keyname` to `artemis`:
+
[source,shell]
....
$ openstack keypair create --public-key path/to/your-new-ssh-key.pub artemis
....
+
In case of Beaker you should add the public key to the `SSH Keys` section of the `User Preferences`. This way you will be able to login as `root` without
providing a password.
+
* run `gen.sh` to generate Artemis configuration.
+
[NOTE]
====
You will be prompted for "Vault password". This is then used to encrypt master key file in your configuration, and Artemis will use it to decrypt the file when needed. This password is completely local to your configuration, it is not shared with anyone else.
====
+
[source,shell]
....
$ bash ./gen.sh
....

== Minishift and Scaffold

=== Install requirements

==== Docker

Currently, Docker is required to run the development environment.

[TIP]
====
Feel free to submit a patch allowing the use of Podman! :)
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are running Fedora 31+, where Docker does not work out of the box, follow https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-docker-on-fedora-31[this guide] to get it working.
====

Follow https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/[this guide] to install Docker CE on Fedora.

==== Skaffold

Skaffold is a development tool for local Kubernetes development. To install it, follow  https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/[this guide].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, the most recent versions of Skaffold are not working properly for our use case, use https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/v1.5.0/skaffold-linux-amd6[version 1.5] instead.
====

==== Minishift

Minishift is a local OpenShift cluster running in a KVM VM on your workstation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, the most recent versions of Minishift are not working properly for our use case, use version `v1.29.0` instead.
====

To install it, follow https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html#installing-manually[this guide].

After installation, follow https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.html#setting-up-kvm-driver[this guide] to set up the virtualization environment.

Minishift makes requests to the GitHub API to download an image. Sometimes, the GitHub limits the request from IP addresses - to solve this limitation, follow https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/docs/source/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-getting-started.adoc#github-api-rate-limit-exceeded[this guide].

==== Openshift Client Tools

Openshift Client Tools are required to interact with a Minishift cluster. To install them, follow https://docs.okd.io/1.5/cli_reference/get_started_clihtml#cli-linux[this guide].

=== Create configuration

Follow the shared <<_create_configuration>> instructions.

=== Start the development environment

Start the development environment by sourcing the `develop.sh` script:

[source,shell]
....
$ source develop.sh
....

The first execution of the script will take some time, as it needs to start Minishift and build Artemis containers for the first time.

[NOTE]
====
To change the verbosity of the script, use environment variable `DEBUG`:

[source,shell]
....
$ DEBUG=3 source develop.sh
....
====

=== Interaction with the development environment

==== Don't start Minishift

If you want to interact with the Minishfit and Skaffold, you can source `develop.sh` together with the `-s` option. Such use will not start Minishift nor Skaffold - the script will prepare the environment, but won't progress further.

[source,shell]
....
$ source develop.sh -s
....

==== Trigger redeployment

If you want to redeploy Artemis you made changes, press `Enter` in the terminal where you sourced the `develop.sh` script. This is called a _manual_ deployment trigger, and it is a bit saner then the default trigger which redeploys automatically if any of the files changed.

==== Details of local development services

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you have sourced the `develop.sh` script with the `-s` option before interacting with MiniShift via `oc` command.
====

* RabbitMQ Management Console
** hostname: `$(oc get route artemis-api)`
** user: `guest`
** password: `guest`

* RabbitMQ Management Console
** hostname: `$(oc get route artemis-rabbitmq-management)`
** user: `guest`
** password: `guest`

* PostgreSQL:
** user: `artemis`
** password: `artemis`
** database: `artemis`

[NOTE]
====
If Artemis is killed (e.g. Ctrl+C), wait for all pods to quit before sourcing `develop.sh` again. You can use `oc get pods` to inspect pods still running.
====


== Docker Compose

This is the most lightweight development setup: it spawns the necessary requirements - RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL and Redis - in Docker containers on your workstation, while Artemis services - API server, dispatcher, scheduler and workers - are launched as daemons.

[NOTE]
====
Artemis server and its CLI tool, `artemis-cli`, exist as separate projects in this repository. Each has its own requirements, and you have to install them as such. We are using https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry] to manage installations.
====

* Artemis service lives in `server` directory:
+
[source,shell]
....
$ cd server/
....
+
* create a local installation of Artemis:
+
[source,shell]
....
$ poetry install
....
+
Poetry will take care of creating a dedicated virtual environment, installing requirements, and makes it accessible via `poetry run` or `poetry shell`.
+
* follow the shared <<_create_configuration>> instructions.
* launch RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL and Redis containers:
+
[source,shell]
....
$ docker-compose up
....
+
[TIP]
====
Add `-d` option to run containers in _detached_ mode, i.e. on the background:

[source,shell]
....
$ docker-compose up -d
....
====
+
* start Artemis:
+
[source,shell]
....
$ bash nominishift-develop.sh
....
+
* To stop Artemis, use a well-known `Ctrl+C` combination.
* To stop the RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL and Redis containers, either use `Ctrl+C` as well, or, if you started them in a detached mode, use `docker-compose`:
+
[source,shell]
....
$ docker-compose down
....
+
[TIP]
====
In case you want to remove the persistent storage of PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ containers, use the `-v` option:

[source,shell]
....
$ docker-compose down -v
....

This instructs Docker to remove volumes associated with the containers.
