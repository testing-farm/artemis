= Driver tests

== Driver test checklist

* driver uses a CLI tool to actually query and control the cloud?
** test calling `drivers.run_cli_tool` with correct arguments
** if non-JSON output is supported, test calling `drivers.run_cli_tool` with `json_format=False`
** test propagation of errors coming from `drivers.run_cli_tool`
** test detection of irrecoverable errors

* test release of pool resources
** test all possible resource ID types are accepted by `release_pool_resources`
** test propagation of errors
