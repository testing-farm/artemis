# These patterns are used by Artemis to transform a compose ID to an Image.
#
# NOTE: compose IDs must be escaped: compose IDs, as we have them in our configuration,
# are NOT patterns but simple strings, with all those dots and possibly other characters
# that could do nasty things when used in patterns. Therefore, we must apply a filter
# to escape these characters, to make them match literaly.
#
# NOTE: compose IDs must be wrapped with `^` and `$`, to match fully. Otherwise, it may
# happen one compose ID - being a substring of another compose ID, like `RHEL-7.9` and
# `RHEL-7.9-updates-20200102` - could lead to matching incorrect image. By enforcing
# the start and end of the pattern, we make sure we match the whole compose ID, or
# nothing at all.

# Key is a pattern, matching an compose, value tells Artemis to which image
# it should map it to.
