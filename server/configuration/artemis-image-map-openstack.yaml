# The file mapping compose names to actual OpenStack images supported by the tenant.
#
# Note: the matching depends on the use of regular expressions. Compose names in this file
# are treated as patterns Artemis tries to match against the compose specified by the guest
# request environment. When using as patterns, compose names must be modified slightly:
#
# * use `\` to escape any otherwise significant characters, namely `.` - these have special
#   meaning when used in regular expressions.
# * wrap the compose name pattern with `^` and `$` - since the entries are tested in the
#   same order they are specified in this file, enforcing the full match prevents any unexpected
#   partial matches.
